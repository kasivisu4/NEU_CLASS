# Expernetial Project

## Project Description :

This project is an experiential project in collaboration with the Cordiance Company. The goal of this project is to get the closest possible UNSPSC code match for the Avalara Tax description. To begin this project, we were provided with two data files: UNSPSC and Avalara. 

UNSPSC file contains code to be matched and it is divided into 4 levels: 

- Commodity level 

- Class level 

- Family level 

- Segment level 

Avalara file contains Avalara Tax System code, its description and additional information related to the same.
